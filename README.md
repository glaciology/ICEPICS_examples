# ICEPICS_examples
This repo contains the code to create the figures for the ICEPICS proposal, using Operation IceBridge and ICESat-2 data
For Operation IceBridge ATM laser altimetry data, we load files for 2 different icecaps at different dates and illustrate elevation change.
For ATLAS data, we show how we collected the data from NSIDC (relying heavily on previous work) and exported particular subsets to CSV files for subsequent visualization for our proposal using QGIS.
