# ICEPICS_examples
This repo contains the code to create the figures for the ICEPICS proposal, using Operation IceBridge and ICESat-2 data
For Operation IceBridge ATM laser altimetry data, we load files for 2 different icecaps at different dates and illustrate elevation change.
For ATLAS data, we show how we collected the data from NSIDC (relying heavily on previous work) and exported particular subsets to CSV files for subsequent visualization for our proposal using QGIS.  


If you are having trouble viewing the files, it sounds like it may be on the github backend.
"Sorry, something went wrong"
You can 1) Download the files and view them locally in your favorite editor or notebook system, or 
2) Open a new tab with https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/, and paste the link there to view.  

Solution 2 comes from https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11
